    <h1>Welcome to my Pride Cycle Simulation Website</h1>
    <p>This website is meant to model how pride spreads and how we can turn to humility in our lives. Pride and humility are some of the major themes in the Book of Mormon, and I want to explore them further. That is part of the reason why I made this website: I want to gain additional insights into how pride works and how we can turn to humility.</p>
    <p>To calculate how a box on the grid changes, I first add up the pride of all the surrounding boxes. I then divide that number by 240 and add it to the box. I then add prosperity of a cell is surrounding humble cells and take away prosperity if a cell is surrounding prideful cells. This is meant to show how pride and humility spread. Surrounding yourself with people who are prideful or humble will reflect on yourself. Humbe people help each other, causing them to become more prosperous. If I took this simulation further, I could show how these prosperous people eventually can lose sight and become prideful, leading to less prosperity.</p>
    <h1>How to Run the Simulation</h1>
    <p>Click on the simulation tab to navigate to the simulation. At the top of the page, there is a purple slider you can use to control how fast the simulation runs. Below the speed slider, there are two boxes, one red and one blue. Click on one of the boxes to select them. Once you select a box, you can control the starting conditions of the simulation. Below the boxes is the simulation grid. Click on the simulation grid to change a cellâ€™s color. Red squares represent pride and blue squares represent humility. Once you are done setting the starting condition, click on the play button. This will start the simulation.</p>
